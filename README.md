# Lightning Turtles?

Turtles are slow :turtle:... What if we add a bolt of lightning to it in a lab?

This Lighting Lab is happening online on Fri 15 May - 1110 to 1120. In this Lightning Lab, you will be learning and experimenting with the [turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) python library. This lab would be 10 mins long and is split into 2 sections.
- For the first section (5mins), you will be **viewing a 5 min workshop video that will go through the basics of turtle.py**
- For the second section (5mins), you will need to use **turtle.py** to draw a drawing and submit your drawing to [https://tinyurl.com/bbcs20lightningturtle](https://tinyurl.com/bbcs20lightningturtle).
  * While drawing, you would need to adhere to the central theme of (ENTER THEME HERE)
  * But what exactly is the picture/diagram that you draw is **entirely up to you**. You can draw pictures as simple as a rectangle or as complex as a map of singapore :laughing:

## The Theme for this lighting lab is...
**(ENTER THEME HERE ON THAT DAY)**

## Submittables:  
1) your drawings (made using turtle.py)
2) an explanation (in 100 words or less) why your drawing fulfils/matches the theme given.
3) python code which you used to draw the drawing

## Some things to take note:
1) You can either submit links (for eg: repl.it links) OR upload the image/txt/python files itself
2) You can either work in pairs or individually
3) Successful submissions with logical explanations would get extra chances for Day 2's Lucky Draw.
4) Standard Code of Conduct, NO direct plagiarism from anywhere. (Googling is allowed)
5) There is no limit to the amount of times you can submit (but no spamming entries please!)

NOTE: For a submission considered as successful, you have to submit BEFORE 1120 and have all 3 submittables.(submissions after stipulated ending time would be judged on a case-by-case basis, for eg: if you have a wifi issue, etc)
