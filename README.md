# Turtle.py

Hello Coders! Welcome to the first **Lightning Lab of BuildingBloCS Online Conference Day 2**

I am Joel and together with me conducting this Lightning Lab is Rose and Hongshuo.

In this Lightning Lab, you will be learning and experimenting with the [turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) python library. This lab would be 10 mins long and is split into 2 sections.
- For the first section (5mins), you will be **viewing a 5 min workshop video that will go through the basics of turtle.py**
- For the second section (5mins), you will need to use **turtle.py** to draw a picture/diagram.
  * The picture/diagram that you draw is **entirely up to you**. You can draw pictures as simple as a rectangle or as complex as a map of singapore :excited:
